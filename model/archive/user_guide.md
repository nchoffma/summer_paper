# New Dynamic Public Finance: A User's Guide
Golosov, Tyvinski, and Werning

## Introduction

- Goal: Extend the Mirrleesian framework (static model) into dynamic settings
    - Does not rely on *exogenously specified* tax instruments, as the Ramsey approach 
- Use this approach to revisit three issues in public finance
    1. Positive distortion in savings (contrasts with 0 capital taxation result)
    1. With stochastically evolving skills, perfect tax smoothing not optimal
        - labor income tax rates affected by agg shocks
    1. Time inconsistency problem different
        - Ramsey: gov't wants to tax sunk capital
        - Mirrlees: gov't wants to exploit past information on types
- Workhorse model: two-period economy
    - Aggregate uncertainty regarding gov't purchases, rates of return on savings
    - Idiosyncratic productivity shocks
- Private information + stochastic skill evolution introduces two *wedges*: distortions in marginal decisions of agents (deviation from Euler equation)
    1. Consumption-labor: difference between marginal rates of substitution
    1. Capital wedge: consumption vs. savings
- Ramsey vs. Mirrlees
    - Ramsey
        - Gov't chooses taxes from *exogenously specified* set of instruments
        - Lump sum taxes are first-best (least distortionary), so goal is usually to mimic these w/ proportional taxes
    - Mirrlees
        - No exogenous restrictions on tax instruments
        - Informational frictions (private info) *endogenously* limits the feasible instruments
        - Private information creates tradeoff between redistribution and incentive compatibility
- Numerical simulations
    - Labor wedge: determined by elasticity and skill shocks
    - Capital wedge: determined by probability and magnitude of adverse shock

## Literature Review

- Werning (2002), Golosov, Kocherlakota, and Tyvinski (2003)
    - Mirrleesian framework in std. neoclassical growth model
    - Werning (2002): conditions for optimality of smoothing labor income taxes over time, states
    - Golosov et. al (2003)
        - optimal to distort savings if skills evolve stochastically (why?)
        - Kocherlakota (2005) extends to model w/ agg shocks
- Werning (2002), Shimer and Werning (2005), Abraham and Pavoni (2003)
    - Optimal taxation when capital not observable and *r* not taxed
- Farhi and Werning (2007): optimal *estate* taxation
    - Progressive estate taxes, arising from optimality of mean-reverting consumption across generations
- Albaneesi (2006): optimal taxation of entrepreneurs
    - Sign of optimal wedge (of entrepreneurial effort) undetermined
- da Costa and Werning (2005): optimal inflationary tax is 0
- Albaneesi and Sleet (2006), Kocherlakota (2005), Golosov and Tyvinski (2006)
    - Government uses tax policy to implement optimal allocations
    - Incomplete markets

## Model

- Planning problem
    - Constraints on tax instruments arise as result of informational frictions 
        - Gov't only observes *y*, not type or effort
    - Two steps:
        1. Find allocations that maximize social welfare function, s.t. resource and IC constraints
        1. Find taxes that give rise to these allocations
