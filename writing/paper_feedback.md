1. What facts about heterogeneity in asset returns are we trying to capture? 
    - Is it heterogeneity in entrepreneurial outputs, e.g. Zuckerberg and Gates? 
        - I.e. real output
        - If so, elasticity argument makes sense
        - As does persistence in infinite horizon case  
    - Or, is it heterogeneity in asset returns?
