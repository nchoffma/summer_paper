\title{Literature Review: Dynamic Optimal Taxation}
\author{}
\date{}

\begin{document}
    
\paragraph{Summary:} The goal of this document is to summarize previous findings from the literature on dynamic optimal (Mirrleesian) taxation. Within this, there are two sub-goals:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Characterize the existing intuition on dynamic capital (income) taxation, to note what changes when we assume heterogeneous \textit{returns}, rather than labor productivities. 
    \item Characterize the existing intuition on dynamic labor income taxes, to highlight the similarities and contrasts between the intuitions behind taxing these sources of income. 
\end{enumerate}

\section{\cite{albanesi2006dynamic}}

\begin{itemize}
    \item The focus here is mainly on the implementation of constrained-efficient allocations in a decentralized economy. 
    \item As in other studies, such as \cite{golosov2003optimal} (section \ref{sec:golosov03}), \cite{albanesi2006dynamic} find the optimality of a positive intertemporal (savings) wedge 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intuition: in order to ensure that the proper labor effort is supplied, savings should be taxed in order to prevent agents from self-insuring against future labor income shocks
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{\cite{shourideh2014optimal}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item A proposition analogous to Proposition 2 in \cite{shourideh2014optimal} appears in our current paper. There are three implications of Proposition 2: 
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The long-run wealth distribution has a Pareto tail
        \item WEdges independent of history
        \item Consumption of old related to promised utility in a history-independent way
    \end{enumerate}
    Points (2) and (3) do not apply to our model, as we have dynamic complementarities and infinitely-lived agents. Point (1) may apply. 
    \item Optimal savings tax: subsidize savings of old, tax savings of young 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Savings of young \textit{tightens} the incentive problem, because it offers insurance against negative shock in future 
        \item Savings of old \textit{relaxes} incentive problem, as it confers more consumption to their descendants, relaxing the descendants' incentive constraint.
    \end{itemize} 
    \item Progressive bequest subsidy echoes result in \cite{farhi2010progressive}: should subsidize bequests, which is a distortion, and distort the decisions of more productive agents \textit{less}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Counter to \cite{golosov2003optimal}: in this model, saving \textit{increases} resources in the future (by relaxing the incentive constraint of the future generation), while in the models of labor income, saving \textit{decreases} future resources (through diminished labor effort)
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}


\section{\cite{kocherlakota2005zero}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Optimal wealth tax is zero in expectation, and regressive: high for surprisingly low-skilled agents, and low for surprisingly high-skilled. 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Intuition is the same as before: in order to ensure efficient exertion of labor effort, need to deter agents from carrying a high level of wealth into the next period. 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Crucial distinction: because utility is additively separable between consumption and labor, marginal utilities and IMRS are publicly observable: private information does not affect either. In our paper, this is not the case. 
\end{itemize}

\section{\cite{golosov2003optimal}} \label{sec:golosov03}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Main result is \textit{inverse Euler equation}
    \item Intuition is as usual: savings reduce the dependence of \( t+1 \) consumption on \( t+1 \) skill level, which tightens the incentive problem. Thus, savings should be taxed
\end{itemize}

\section{\cite{farhi2010progressive}}
\begin{itemize}
    \item In dynamic model, \cite{farhi2010progressive} discuss an implementation using linear inheritance taxes (levied on heirs, rather than estates). 
    \item Nests \cite{kocherlakota2005zero} ``zero expected wealth tax'' result as a special case in which the utility of descendants valued \textit{only} through altruism of parents (\( \nu_t = 0 \))
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Otherwise, expected inheritance taxes not zero 
    \end{itemize}
    \item Intuition: as in the static model, the ``progressive subsidies'' on bequests follows from insurance motives 
    \begin{itemize}
        \item If the planner values utility of future generations in above and beyond altruism of ancestors, she wants to insure them against the risk of being born into a poor dynasty 
        \item Consumption across generations is \textit{mean-reverting} (think ``squeezing'' consumption from \( t \) to \( t+1 \))
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
