# Outline

## Introduction

- What is our main contribution? 
    - Optimality of positive wedges on risk-free and idiosyncratic savings
- Why is this important?
    - Rising inequality, due in part to capital income
    - Capital investments are both a source of income and a driver of economic growth
    - Need to balance efficiency and redistribution
        - Good justification for Mirrleesian approach
- How do we go about this? 
    - Mirrlees: tax schedule may be nonlinear, but subject to informational frictions. 
    - Model: agents differ in the returns to their idiosyncratic investment technologies, which produce intermediate goods
    - Intermediate goods used to produce final good by CES aggregation, which creates complimentarities to investments
        - this answers a critical question: why should we not simply all give our money to the most productive investor? 
    - Two period, then dynamic
- How would we summarize our results? 
    - Two-period setting: U-shaped pattern for marginal distortions 
        - Positive *distortions*, positive *taxes* 
            - Contrast to Ramsey result
            - Affirms Golosov etal result, even without labor income
            - Larger distortion on capital income
        - Drivers: investment ratio, return ratio
            - Return ratio hump-shaped: the planner would like to equate MPK with R for all types, but is constrained from doing so by informational frictions
            - Investment ratio: strictly increasing; higher types invest more relative to their first-period consumption
    - Infinite horizon
        - Savings wedge: independent of history
        - Investment wedge: history-dependent, falling in *w*
        
## Lit review

- Basic Mirrlesian papers: static, labor income
- FW Capital taxation: want to flesh this out more
    - Role for capital taxation in economies with private information
    - Arises when agents earn common returns, and most income comes from labor market
- Heterogeneous rates of return
    - Phelan papers: same contrast as before
    - UIOLI
    - Gerritsen: we include safe asset (important for lower types)
- Power laws: BBZ, Picketty
