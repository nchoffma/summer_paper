- Main question
    - How should capital and its associated income be taxed in an economy with heterogeneous rates of return?
    - Main result: TBD
- Motivation
    - Current debate
        - Increase in share of wealth at the top
            - What factors give the wealth distribution its shape?
                - Lots of risk, variable rates of return
                - Variation in entrepreneurial talent--some of which should be put to work, some perhaps not.
        - Case to be made (Saez and Zucman) that taxation is insufficiently progressive
            - Income somewhat mobile between labor and capital
            - Disproportionate tax burdens, due to writeoffs and the above
            - One suggested fix is a tax to capital
        - We investigate this in a model following Mirrlees
            - Why Mirrlees?
                - Captures the equity-efficiency tradeoff
                - Ramsey taxation: capital should be taxed at zero in the long run
                - Allows for redistributive motives
            - Implementation
                - Given an intertemporal wedge, we explicitly compare implementation with capital income and wealth taxation
            - Distribution
                - We study the effects of these tax instruments on the long-run distribution of wealth, as well as levels of output
        - Intellectual merit
            - Improves upon the "zero capital taxation" result
            - This is a necessary start to a better understanding of optimal taxation of wealthy individuals
